# Dex

A DApp to showcase my developer skills on the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. This decentralised exchange can trade several mock cryptocurrencies of DIA, BAT, ZRX and REP. The DApp has a clean UI, displaying the trades with an animated graphical interface. (Only for educational, experimental purposes and not for a real deployment on a test network)

## Demo

## Usage

This project is not live on any blockchain and can only be used using the [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) testing framework. Feel free to download this project and test it out.
